<!--
    The Router is another Blazor component that handles routing within the application.
    When we will browse to the application pages, the browser will be making a request and it was
    intercepted by this Router and it will be searching if it could find a component specific to
    the requested url.
    At the start of the application, our assembly is going to be scanned for components that can be
    routed to. And that is then contained on the list of pages that is handled on this router.
